## Introducing Today's Project!

In this project, I will demonstrate how to use Quicksight to analyse data I'm doing this project to learn this skill.

### Tools and concepts

S3 and Quicksight

### Project reflection

This project took me approximatively 1h

I will check on the list

---

## Upload project files into S3

 manifest.json and netflix files.

I edited the manifest.json file by mys3://pelagiemfunga-projectquicksight/netflix_titles.csv It’s important to edit this file because Quicksight will know where to find the file to analyse.

## Download the Dataset

I connected the S3 bucket to QuickSight by visiting datashets

The manifest.json file was important in this step because tells QuickSight what your dataset looks like, so QuickSight knows how to understand the data and show it in charts or graphs. Without this map, QuickSight might get confused and not show your data correctly!

## My first visualization

To create visualizations on QuickSight, I import my data, prepare it if needed, choose a visual type, and build charts inside an analysis.

The chart/graph shown here is a breakdown of te release year of the content of Netflix.

We created this graph by simply clicking on the ‘release_year’ data label, and changing the automatically generated chart from a bar chart.

## Using filters

Filters are useful as it allow me to see what i need

This visualization is a breakdown years, movies and so on.

As a finishing touch, I donwload the PDF

I follow the procedure listed in the course.
