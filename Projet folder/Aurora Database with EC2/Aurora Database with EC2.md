## Introducing Today's Project!

### What is Amazon Aurora?

Amazon Aurora is a high-performance, fully managed relational database engine built for the cloud and compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL.
It is designed to provide the speed and availability of enterprise databases while remaining cost-effective and easy to operate.

### How I used Amazon Aurora in this project

In today's project, I used Amazon Aurora to connect it to my EC2.

### Creating an Aurora Cluster

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables, which are collections of rows and columns. Kind of like a spreadhsheet! We call it "relational" because the rows relate to the columns and vice-versa.

I use AWS Aurora if we needed something large-scale, with peak performance and uptime. This is because Aurora databases use clusters (more on that later!).

## Halfway through I stopped!

I stopped creating my Aurora database because I need EC2 instance.

### Features of my EC2 instance

Since a EC2 instance is a virtual machine, a good way to think about key pairs is like the login credentials to your own computer...except it's all virtual!

When I created my EC2 instance, I took particular note of Public IPv4 DNS.

## Then I could finish setting up my database

A database cluster in Aurora is a group of database copies that work together so your data is always available.
