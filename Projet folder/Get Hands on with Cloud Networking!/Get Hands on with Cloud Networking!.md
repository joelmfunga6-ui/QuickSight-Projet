## I'm building a cloud networking architecture

In this hands-on networking series, I'm learning about VPC By the end of the 9 projects, I'm learning about cloud networking because I need real skills in VPC

Businesses traditionally had to build, maintain, and secure their own physical networks. Cloud networking changed things by providing ready-to-use, scalable, and globally available network infrastructure that you can consume on demand without managing the hardware.

## Excited to share my progress - build a VPC with me!

I will keep myself accountable by tracking my daily progress and reviewing what I’ve learned at the end of each week.
My reward is allowing myself a relaxing break or something I enjoy once I complete each milestone.
